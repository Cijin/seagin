# Building in public

The last few years my main focus has been learning to be better at programming, although 
as I gain better grasp of programming and it's principles I feel like something is missing. 
Which made me realize that I have been sharpening my tools, but I'm not really using the tool 
to build something. Although, I've built many things for companies, from internal tools, 
developer tools, entire websites, etc. I've never really pursued to build things for myself 
that maybe some others might find useful.

## The next step

I just feel like, this is the next step to getting better at writing code. To write a 
lot more of it, but with an added goal. Build something along the way. It's fun to be 
learning new things and trying new tech and I think I'll always do that. But there is 
another habit I would like to cultivate, to finish things I start and tell others about it.
I'll be honest, that last part scares the shit out of me :D.

We (me and my best friend) are building some interesting tools over at [Spicylabs](https://spicylabs.co/). Everything 
else I'm working on can be found here.
