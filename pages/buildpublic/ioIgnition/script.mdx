# Script.js

As far as I understand, at it's core, all that an analytics tool needs to is to send 
a request from a client (users's website) via a script to the server (our server) and provide 
this info to the client via a dashboard.

The script is done, it was much easier, i took inspiration from the [plausible-tracker](https://github.com/plausible/plausible-tracker).
It is very simple and has enough info in there to be certified analytics (i think).

That was the easy part, the next step is to create a plan, which I have a rough idea about. I'm going
to try and get it validated by a few people, just to ensure I'm on the right path.
