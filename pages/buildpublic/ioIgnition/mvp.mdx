# Finishing the MVP

In all fairness, I really enjoy building and getting stuck, then unstuck. It's enjoyable, 
challenging and absolutely exhilarating to see the goal you were trying to achieve. It's 
crazy to think that two weeks ago, this was just a curiosity. I was looking at an analytics dashboard 
and I was like, "I wonder how it all works?." Then I was like, "Can I build it?", I think I've 
answered my questions, yes I can. It is not as easy as I thought, and the parts that I thought
would be the hardest, turned out to be not that hard.


## The hard disguised as easy

This one I was immediately sure, on how to do it. Send a request when a user enters the 
site, send one when they exit the page. Easy, right? It wasn't, what I forgot to take into 
account was that browser cancels all outstanding requests when the code is unmounted, ex: user 
closes the tab. Maybe this was a skill issue, but I've never had to worry about a request failing 
post code being unmounted before. 

## Getting Unstuck

It's hard when you don't have the right vocabulary to explain the problem to a search engine or AI. 
Took me a couple of days, as I benched this issue to the side to tackle it later. That was the 
smartest move on my part. That I've done before, I've often done a task that I know I can do, when 
I'm stuck on something I have no clue about.

When I did return to this task, my mindset was different. I was no longer using the same words to 
describe my problem. My search provided better results and eventually ChatGPT brought to my attention 
about an API that does exactly this, it was called [navigator.sendBeacon()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon).
Although, I did not end up using this API, as I read the documentation I figured out 
how I could do this by updating my request with one simple parameter.

This parameter was called `keepalive`, which then would tell the browser that this request should 
be kept alive, when page looses visibility. As I'm writing this, I've realized I've not handled 
the scenario where the page is visible again, i.e. uses switches tabs and returns. One more item 
for the shipping [tasks](https://github.com/Cijin/ioignition/issues/17).

## What's next?

The goal was to build something that would satisfy my curiosity and be useful to at least one 
more person. You see, programmers are great at building things, not so great at selling them. That's 
the other thing I'm trying to learn. To sell my software. To be sustainable and be able to build the 
things you want, when you want, as you want, you need money. You can either get this money from the outside 
or you can learn to sell. I like the freedom of building things as I want, dictating how it should 
work, what it does and what it will never do.

The goal when building `ioigntion` was to build a privacy first, minimal analytics tool that does 
not slow down your webpage. Currently the script is at `3.8kb`, without any optimizations.

As for what is next, I'll be working on the finishing touches and completing the items 
on the list above and then talking about it.
