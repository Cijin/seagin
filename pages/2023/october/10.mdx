## Implementing the Pratt parser: Integer Literals

The simplest integer literal in the monkey programming language is:

`5;`

So this was the starting point, and extended the parser to be able to parse this 
expression. This required adding a `parseIntegerLiteral` methods to the parser.

This was very similar to adding the parser for an identifier, the only difference being
the value was of type `int64` instead of a string.
