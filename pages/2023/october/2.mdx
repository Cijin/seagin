## Parsing program statements

Started with parsing statements, it's made me appreciate all programming languages, 
and what it takes to make them work.

So far, the focus is to be able to parse simple statements like `let x = 5`. Today, the parser 
was updated to be able to parse upto the `=` and ignore everything after for now. As the 
language needs to allow statements like `let y = 5 * 5` and even function statements like 
`let z = add(x + y)`.

The parser also, keeps track of errors in a very basic way. With a very primitive stack trace 
that you can use to see where the error first originated.
