## Parsing Expressions

Turns our parsing expressions is much different than parsing statements. Thank God! I was like, 
do I have to go through each possible combination of expression to construct an ast.


Challenges of parsing expressions:
  * Operator precedence, `5 * 5 + 10`
  * Prefix with Infix Operators, `-5 -10`
  * Parntheses as an Operator, `5 * (add(2, 3) + 10)`

Since, smart people have figured this already, we are going to be using the
(Pratt Parsing)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_parser] to parse 
expressions.

Also, went through some terminology like:

  * Prefix operator `--5`
  * Postfix operator `5++`
  * Infix operator `8 * 5`o

There were no code updates today. In the next sessoin, I'm going to be preparing 
the AST.
