## Implementing the Pratt parser: Identifiers

The main idea behind the pratt parser is the association of token types with parsing functions.
In the last session, the types for such functions were added. Today, the parser was extended to
include prefix & infix function maps.
 
### Identifiers

The simplest identifier in the monkey programming language is:

`foobar;`

So this was the starting point, and extended the parser to be able to parse this 
expression. This required adding a `parseExpressionStatement` &  `parseExpression` methods to the parser.

The `parseExpression` method took a priority, which is a `enum` of precedences amongst the operators in
the language. Although the precedence is not completely implemented, it is a good start to have it in place.
