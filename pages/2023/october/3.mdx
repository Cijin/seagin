## Parsing `return` statements

This was much easier than parsing `let` statement. As `return` statements only consists 
of a token type (return) and an expression.

Just as for `let`, parsing the expression will be done later. So it's skipped over when
parsing the expression.

This finishes parsing over expressions in the `monkey` language that the parser is being
created for. As there are only two expressions `let` & `return`
