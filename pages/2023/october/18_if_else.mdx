## Implementing the Pratt parser: If Expression

If expressions in monkey programming language looks just like any other. Ex:

```
if (x > y) {
  return x;
} else {
  return y;
}
```
Or
```
if (x > y) {
  return x;
}
```

`if-else` conditionals in monkey are expressions, i.e. they produce a value. The 
return is implied to be the last line if not explicitly returned. Although, it's 
obvious but for sake of clarity:

`if (<condition>) <consequence> else <alternative>`

Consuquence & alternative's are block statements so they get parsed like regular 
statements.

Once the structured is established, the rest is fairly simple as it does not vary 
vastly from the rest of the program.
