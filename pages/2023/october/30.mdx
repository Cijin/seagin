## Evaluating Symbols

Took a break once the parser was finished, getting back to it. Today was the first 
day I made some progress since finishing the parser.


Made a couple of small incremental additions to be able to evaluate booleans, integers, 
and `null`.

### Tree Walking Interpreter

You can read about the other approaches in the book. Tree walking interepreter is the 
easiest to implement & for the sake of learning that's the one we are going with.

A tree walking interpreter takes the AST from the parser and intereprets it "on the fly", 
without preprocessing or compliation.

### Object Representation

We are representing all values as objects that we define. There will be no native types. 
Again, as it's easier and performance is not really a concern right now.

With that, we implement the foundation for our object system. We define `Object`, `Integer`, 
`Boolean` and `Null`.

### Garbage Collection


The book does not implement any garbage collection but I would like to know how it works. 
So once I'm finished with the interpreter I will extend the interpreter to support garbage 
collection.

### Evaluating Expressions

With the data types defined, we can evaluate literal expressions and map them to their 
representation in the monkey programming language. This is quite easy and straightforward.

### Evaluating Prefix Expressions

Once the above is complete, we can then move on to evaluating prefix expressions `!` & `-`. 
This is where I'm starting to see how minute decisions regarding the behavior of a prgramming 
language are made. For example, in the monkey programming language `!5` equates to `false`. 
As we are defining `5` to be a truthy value, where this would throw an error in golang.

For evaluating prefix expressions, we first evaluate the right. This means we can 
recursively evaluate expressions like `!!true`. Once, the right is evaluated, based 
on the operator `!` or `-`, the appropriate object is returned. If it's a `!` operator 
a boolean is returned, whereas for `-` operator we verify if the operand is an integer 
and return the negated integer.
