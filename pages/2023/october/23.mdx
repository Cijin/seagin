## Finishing the parser

The parser is complete :). All there was left to do was to remove the todo's from 
the `parseLetStatement` & `parseReturnStatement` method. As at the time of parsing 
`let` & `return` statements there was no support for expressions.

The `repl` was updated to now return the parsed output of the program. So as is, 
it returns the ast for the monkey programming language, which I feel is awesome. 
You can see glimplses of how [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) could work. 

The amount of learning so far has been amazing and I understand what the terms `expressions` &
`statements` mean. Also, realized that I've been using those two terms incorrectly.

These are some of the output of the code:

### Let statements
```

Welcome to monkey v0.0.0
Press ctrl-d to exit.

>> let x = 1;
let x = 1;

>> let y = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
let y = ((((1 * 2) * 3) * 4) * 5);

>> let z = 2 / 3 + 1 - 1
let z = (((2 / 3) + 1) - 1);

>>

```

### Function Literal & Calls
```
>> fn() { return fn(x, y) { return x + y }}
fn()return fn(x, y)return (x + y);; // for some reason it's printing two ';', will fix it later
>>
```

### Errors
```
>> let a + b * 3
