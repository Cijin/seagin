# 6th October

## Expression Statements Helper

Added a wrapper for statements with solely a single expression. Ex: `x + 10;`


## Adding String() to Node

Added a method `String` to the Node to make it easy to debug and compare them with 
other AST nodes.

## Implementing the Pratt parser (part 1)

The main idea(s) behind the Pratt Parser:
 * Assosiation of paring functions with token type
 * When a token is encountered the appropriate parsing function is called to return the AST Node
 * Each token can have upto two parsing functions. Depending on wether the token is found in the 
   prefix or infix position

This is what the association above looks like
```go
type (
  prefixParseFn func() ast.Expression
  infixParseFn func(ast.Expression) ast.Expression
)
```
