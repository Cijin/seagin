## Implementing the Pratt parser: Function literals

Function literals look like this:
```
fn(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

The abstract structure of a function looks like this:
```
fn <parameter> <block statement>
```
Having this structure is a good starting point from defining the type to parsing 
function literals.

Although, params are new they are just identifiers seperated by command and surrounded 
by a parantheses. They can also be empty.

There are couple of things to note, functions can return a function inside the body.
```
fn() {
  return fn(x, y) { return x > y; };
}
```

Also, using a function literal as an argument when calling another function is also possible:
```
myFunc(x, y, fn(x, y) { return x > y; });
```

These seemed a bit daunting when I saw them first and expected parsing function literals 
to be a lot more complicated that parsing `if-else` expressions. Turned out not to be 
the case as once parsing function literals as expressions and provide a parsing method 
to parse them, the rest just works. In all honesty it felt amazing.

This one was a lot of fun.
