# Building a interpreter usin Go

Currently, I'm building an interpreter in Go with the help of the [interpreter book](https://interpreterbook.com/). 
It's really good and on point. Surprisingly, I'm having a lot of fun working on it.

So far, I've built the lexer. Currently working on the parser.

It's all [here](https://github.com/Cijin/go-interpreter)
