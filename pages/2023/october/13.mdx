## Implementing the Pratt parser: Prefix & Infix Expressions

This turned out to be quite fun. I assumed it would be a bit more complicated 
than it turned out to be.

### Prefix Expressions

Prefix expressions take the following form `<prefix operator><expression>`, which is 
quite obvious from the name.

This is what it looks like:

```go
type PrefixExpression struct {
  Token token.Token // prefix token
  Operator string
  Right Expression  // operand
}
```

The `String()` method for the ast of a prefix expression is slightly different from 
the others so far. This is done so as to be able see which operand belongs to which operator.

```go
func (pe *PrefixExpression) String() string {
  var out bytes.Buffer

  out.WriteString("(")
  out.WriteString(pe.Operator)
  out.WriteString(pe.Right.String())
  out.WriteString(")")

  return out.String()
}
```

### Precedence

An enum of operator priority  is defined. Ex: `*` has a higher priority compared 
to `+`.

This will be more useful in the next section when working with infix expressions.

### Infix Expression

Infix or Binary expression is of the form `<expression><operator><expression>`. So the type of 
an infix expression has a `Left Expression` along with the `Right`.

Also, the `String()` method for `InfixExpression` is slightly differnt from the `PrefixExpression`.

```go
func (ie *InfixExpression) String() string {
  var out bytes.Buffer

  out.WriteString("(")
  out.WriteString(ie.Left.String())
  out.WriteString(" " + ie.Operator + " ")
  out.WriteString(ie.Right.String())
  out.WriteString(")")

  return out.String()
}

```

Parsing an infix expression is not too differnt from the prefix. The `parseExpression` method 
only required a slight update to be able to generate the correct ast, thanks to recursion. This 
is what the update looks like:

```go
// parser.go

func (p *Parser) parseExpression(precedence int) ast.Expression {
  [...]

  for !p.peedTokenIs(token.SEMICOLON) && precedence < p.peekPrecendence() {
    infix := p.infixParseFns[p.peekToken.Type] // these are registered when instantiating the Lexer
    if infix == nil {
      return leftExp
    }

    p.nextToken()

    leftExp = infix(leftExp)
  }

  [...]
}
```

Now the monkey programming language can parse expressions like these:
```go
		{
			"5 < 4 != 3 > 4", // input
			"((5 < 4) != (3 > 4))", // AST
		},
		{
			"3 + 4 * 5 == 3 * 1 + 4 * 5", // input
			"((3 + (4 * 5)) == ((3 * 1) + (4 * 5)))", // AST
		},

```

That felt good :D. There are still a couple of `Todo`s in the code. But those 
will be tackled soon.
