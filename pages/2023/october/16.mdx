## Implementing the Pratt parser: Boolean Literals & Grouped Expressions

### Boolean

These are not any different from parsing integer literal, so it was fairly straightforward. 
Being able to parse boolean literals meant the tests for prefix & infix expressions could be 
now extended to include booleans.


### Grouped Literals

Ex: `5 * (2 + 2);`

This was also surprisingly easy, thanks to the way the parser is structured. All that 
was needed doing was defining a prser when a paranthesis was encountered. All the parser 
did was peek forward to the next token and the `parseExpression` method did the rest. Without the 
parenthesis it's just an infix statement. Once you got the statement back, all you had to do 
was ensure and peek the closing paren `(`.

The concept of assosiating token types to functions makes things really easy to extend. I was under 
the impression that this would be a long section, quite shocked when it was done in a few lines. Quite 
incredible.
