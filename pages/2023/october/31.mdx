## Evaluating Infix Expressions

This one is fairly simple, as we can use the underlying methods of the language 
we are writing monkey in, in this case Golang.

There are two sets of infix operators:

1. Arithmatic Operators

These are `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`. This implies that the reuturned object type should 
be an integer.

2. Boolean Operators

These are `>`, `<`, `!=`, `==`. The returned object type should be of type boolean.

Both 1 & 2 deal with integer operands. That meant having to support `!=` & `==` for 
boolean operands. Which is fairly straight forward as interfaces can be compared to 
each other in Go.

That completes evaluating expressions in monkey. The next step is Conditionals! :)
