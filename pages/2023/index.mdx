# 4am Club

It used to be the 5am club, but recently I've started waking up at 0430, so the club name 
needs to reflect accordingly.

This was a fairly recurring thing I used to do, always spent my morning trying out something 
new. It's the time I use to learn new things or try out a new tech in depth. I typically
pick one thing and try it out with the help of a book. This time of the morning is amazing, 
it's quiet, it's dark and peaceful. Feels like my time, and I'm focused most of the 
time.

## What I'm upto currently

Currently, I'm building an interpreter in Go with the help of the [interpreter book](https://interpreterbook.com/). 
It's really good and on point. Surprisingly, I'm having a lot of fun working on it.

So far, I've built the lexer. Currently working on the parser.

It's all [here](https://github.com/Cijin/go-interpreter)
