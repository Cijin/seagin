# Extending the interpreter: Strings Part 2

Strings that are not terminated properly will now throw an error. I'm yet to parse 
strings with `\`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`. Not entirely sure how to achieve this, will need 
to look into it or ask for help.

## Evaluating Strings

This would be a lot more challenging if were writing the interpreter in `C`. Luckily, `go` 
has support for string and this makes evaluation way more easier. Although, at some point, 
I like to write the interpreter in `C`, should be fun.

So, all that there was to do is, when a string literal is encountered, convert it to 
a string object.

## Evaluating String Expressions

Also, very easy due to the same reason as above. So monkey now supports `+`, `==`, and 
`!=` on strings.

So, we can now do things like:

```
let s = "hello" + " " + "world";
print(s);

>> hello world
```

Looks trivial, but felt amazing to see the test pass for this. It's funny to think 
what programmers think is amazing.
