# Built in function: `len`

Getting on this interpreter journey has been refreshing, I was feeling uninspired 
about writing code for the last year or so. The last couple of months have flipped 
it, and I can't wait to get to my desk.

I've digressed.

So `builtins` are interesting. They are like regular function but defined within the 
evaluator. In other languages you could use a `for` loop to get the length but since 
we have not defined loops this would be the only way to get a length of a string.

This is interesting because, if you consider things you use to make your code useful 
like listening to a port `server.ListenAndServe`. You are using a method that intern uses an interface 
`net` to communicate to underlying network i/o on your computer. My point is, if you had 
to build this interface yourself the language wouldn't be very useful (for most people).

Although, `len` is a very simple `builtin` function. It was interesting to know 
how one would add it to a programming language.
