## Error Handling

Error handling is quite similar to how `return` statements were handled. If you think 
about it, when a `return` statement is encountered, evaluation stops and `return`s the value 
that has been evaluated from the statements till that point. Encountering an `error` 
is not very different. When an error is encountered you stop evaluation and `return` 
the value, just that in this case it's a `object` of type `error`. Instead of `boolean` 
or `integer` etc.

Kinda like how go handles errors, it's just a value. It's a polarizing topic, but I like 
that an `error` is just a value and you can decide what you want to do with it.

## Binding Identifiers & Enviornment

Currently, the evaluator does not know what to do when a let statement is encountered, 
or for that matter what to do when an identifier is come across, either.

To be able to handle identifiers we need to store the values assosiated with them and 
be able to get these values later on. So we define an `Enviornment`, that wraps a Hash 
map that allows us to store and retreieve identifiers. It only needs two methods and is 
a struct. This should make it easier to define scope for an indentifier. This will be 
handled later when we deal with `function`s and calls.

Once this was in place, the evaluator was updated to accept an `env`iornment variable. That's it.o
