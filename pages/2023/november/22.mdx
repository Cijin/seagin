# Extending the interpreter

For the most part, the interpreter is complete but not very useful as is. There are 
few key things missing. Namely, support for strings, arrays & hashes. In this section will 
be adding those in.


## Strings

Strings, are not very different from integer literals and can use the `string` type of the underlying 
language (in our case go).

The steps were the same as the ones we followed for adding support for integer literals. But, I realized 
that I had forgotten what some of the code did :D, no surprise there I suppose, as the lexer was written 
almost two months ago.

### Adding support for strings in the lexer

Currently, if you have a look at the `lexer.go`. You'll notice that invalid strings are not caught:

```go
		if l.ch == '"' || l.ch == 0 {
			break
		}
```

This will be improved next, so that the parser can return an error instead. Once that's done, I will look 
into escape sequences. `\, \t, \n`


### Parsing strings

Currently, parsing the string is really simple. All we did is register a prefix to parse string literals. 
All this parsing function does is return an ast. This will be improved upon, to return errors for strings 
that are not closed.
