## Function Literals

Since everything in the monkey programming language is an object, functions will 
be the same. Functions are expressions in monkey, i.e. they evaluate to a value, 
which you can assign to an identifier.

ex: `let x = fn(y) { return y };`

We add support for evaluating function literals to our evaluator, which then turns the `ast.FunctionLiteral` 
into an object representation. Which looks like this:

```go
type Function struct {
  Parameters []*ast.Identifier
  Body []*ast.BlockStatement
  Env *Environment
}
```

We use the `env` in the scope of the evaluator when we come across the function literal.

## Closure

Before going ahead with evaluating call expressions out `env` needs to be able to limit scope 
of the `identifiers` that are defined within the function so that they do not overwrite the 
variables defined outside of the function.o

To achieve this the `Environment` is extended to be enclosable, i.e. it can have an `outer`, 
which is a pointer to an outer enviornment. So the `Environment` now looks like this:

```go
type Environment sturct {
  ...
  outer *Environment
}
```

When looking up identifiers the `Get`ter (`env.Get(...)`), will first try to resolve the value 
from the current scope and if it's not defined, it'll try to resolve the identifier from the outer 
environment if one exists.

## Call Expressions

There are three steps to handle calls:

1. Evaluate arguments

Arguments are expressions and our evaluator already knows how to evaluate them. All 
we need to do is ensure there are no errors and return the arguments as `[]Object`s.

2. Extend Environment

We need to create a `NewEnclosedEnvironment` and map the function parameters to it.

3. Evaluate Function Body

Now all that's left to do is evaluate the body, which is simply a `[]ast.BlockStatement`, 
all we need to do is ensure we pass the correct envriornment, and we are done!


That's it! We now have a basic programming language written from scratch. So if you 
run the repl, the new function calls can be tested:


```
Welcome to monkey v0.0.1
Press ctrl-d to exit.
>> let newAdder = fn(x) { fn(y) { x + y } };
>> let addTwo = newAdder(2)
>> addTwo(3)
5
>>
```
