# It's done

Building the interpreter was exactly the thing I needed to get my curiosity back. 
It's helped me get back to writing code every day cause I want to. I'm ever so grateful 
to the author [Thorsten Ball](https://twitter.com/thorstenball) for exploring his curiosity 
and sharing it with in the form of this book. Thank you.

If you ever by the book yourself, you'll notice that there are a few more sections left, 
mainly arrays and hashes. The reason I'm not going through them is that once you've built 
the lexer, parser and the evaluator with basic data types, the rest is not that challenging 
any more. As soon as I was done with strings and I saw that it was `arrays`, I knew straight 
away how it can be parsed and then evaluated.

Since, starting the interpreter book, I've felt inspired to work on a few projects and it's come 
to a point where I need to prioritize.

This is not the end though.

When I bought the interpreter book, I also bought the compiler book. I'll be going through it 
once I complete some of the projects I'm working on at the moment.
