## Evaluating `if` Expression

On encountering an `if` expression during execution the program had to decide how to make 
make sense of the conditional; i.e.:

* The conditional should always evaluate to boolean
* Conditional can be evaluated to be truthy or falsy

The hard part is making the decision, the rest is quite straight forward as we are 
simply executing statements withing the block.

We went with the second one. This simple function can help explain how conditionals 
are evaluated.

```go
func isTruthy(condition object.Object) bool {
	switch condition {
	case TRUE:
		return true
	case FALSE:
		return false
	case NULL:
		return false
	default:
		return true
	}
}
```

As you can see, everything that is not `FALSE` or `NULL` is considered truthy.

### Block Statements

Based on the value the expression is evaluated to, it's easy to make a decision 
wether the `Consequence` needs to be evaluated or the `Alternative`. If there is no 
alternative the `if` expression evaluation returns a `NULL` object. 


## Evaluating `return` Statements

Like most programming languages that i'm aware of, encountering a return value 
halts execution of the block and returns any value if present in the statement. 

So, when a return statement was encountered the value gets unwrapped and `return`ed 
when the statement evalution encounters one.

This works fine for statements like:

```
return 2 * 5;

// or

if (true) {
  return 10;
} else {
  return 5;
}

// also halts execution for the block
return 2 * 5; 
x = 44; // unreachable
```

Since, the generic `evalStatements` method was used for evaluation of the program 
statements and the block statement. There was an issue, there was no order for control 
flow when a return statement was encountered within a block. Ex:

```
if (10 > 1) {
  if (10 > 1) {
	  return 10 // expected value
  }
  return 2 // recieved
}
```

This is easy to see because when `return 10` is encountered by the evaluator the 
value gets unrwapped and returned. This is the expected behavior, but it does not escape 
the outermost block. So execution continues to the `return 2` statement which gets `return`ed 
instead.

An easy fix for this was to seperate the execution of `blockStatements` and `program` 
into seperate methods over the generic `evalStatements`. Also, block statements will 
not unwrap the `return` statement to it's value. That is handled by the program.
