# Hey
 
My name is Cijin Cherian. I have been living in Thailand for the past few years.

I'm a software developer by profession. I've been writing code for about 4 years now. I mostly write
code in `Go` and `Typescript`. The last year I was working on creating a typescript developer tool around
real time events [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@amityco/ts-sdk). Turns out I really like working on
developer tools.

In terms of Frontend frameworks, I work with `React`. Recently I've been enjoying using `htmx` with `Go`.

Before I fell in love with writing code, I used to be a diving instructor for about six years.
One of those days as we were coming back from the dive site, me and my mate were on the roof the boat
enjoying the sunset and he was like your name is quite hard to pronounce. So he started thinking of 
ways to make it easier to say. He finally got to, 
> It's sea like the sea (pointing to it) and gin like gin & tonic

I've kept it since. Makes it easy for people to remember my name too.
