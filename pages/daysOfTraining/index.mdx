# Training History
 
## Swimming

Started swimming when I was young (around 7) I think. Competed a bit, dreaded the 0500 wake up :D, but for
the most parts I enjoyed it. Although I did missed playing Cricket with my friends like the a regular kid somedays.
Wasn't very good competitevely, I was happy if I could see the leg of the person ahead of me.

## Football

Played football when I was in school and university, wasn't very good at it either. This is turning out to
be a recurring theme now :D'


## Weight Training

Started training with weights when I was 25, thanks to Crosfit. Although I couldn't afford Crosfit after about 7 months of training.
I was a dive instructor then and you don't make a lot.
It helped me get faimiliar with weights. Still fumbled around the gym for a year or two after, not really having a goal or tracking much.
I've only started tracking my workouts since last December and it has been a game changer. Workouts have been consistent, with slight variations in reps depending
how my joints feel.'


## Weightlifting

About 5 years after my first Crosfit class, I went back to one about 3 months ago to gain some cardio fitness.
Ended up loving the weightlifting part of the classes, so much so that I reprogrammed my regular weight training
sessions. So currently I'm learning the snatch and the clean & jerk.
