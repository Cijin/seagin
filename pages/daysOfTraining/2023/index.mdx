# Focus for 2023
 
 2022 was kinda ruff when it came to training. I went through periods of some relentless
 training (about 2-4 hours a day) before and after work. Very little breaks or rest days, 
 and no surprise it led to burnout and I couldn't look at a barbell, my bicycle or the pool
 from August to end of November 2022.

 Not training doesn't do me any good. If I recall, I've felt the worse in my life when I've 
 not trained for a long period of time.

 Thankfully, start of December I felt like I could go back to the gym. Started really slow, easy
 , and spent only 30 t0 45 minutes in the gym for most of December and January. This was key, 
 the simplicity and the ease of the whole thing. 

 I only did 5 x 5 of bench, deadlift and squats, per week. One light and heavy sesion for each throught 
 the week. The light sessions were focused on improving any technique flaws that I might have had.


## October 2023

I'll summarize most of the year till October, and then update regulary after.
When I started in December I was doing only the Benchpress, the Squat and the Deadlift. Over the 
course of the year the Benchpress faded away as I lost interest in it. Added some bicep workouts, weighted
pull ups, weighted dips but they din last very long. 

Although, I sort of became obsessed with the Squat, to the point I do it 4 times/week. Two days 
of front squat and two back squat days. Each with one light (70% max) with pause at the bottom
and one heavier (80-85% max) session.o

## Weightlifting

Around August, I wanted to try Crosfit again, it was humbling and hard at the same time. Humbling cause,
 I realized my depth on the Squat was not great and I couldn't front squat well or comfortably. But doing Crosfit 
introduced me to Snatches & Clean & Jerk. It was a good challenge, and involved a lot of techinque.
 It felt like learning a new skill, so I decided to go all in on it. That meant not being able to 
train with nothing heavier than a barbell, but after a couple of weeks of not getting anywhere 
it started to click, I'm still learning but I can feel the right contact and weight moving 
up and overhead on contact with the hips.

I still squat at the end of my Snatch and Clean drills. Do very little Crosfit.
