## Snatch Drills

20kg Barbell
  
  * Warmup: BTN Press, Overhead Squat, Tall muscle snatch
  * 4 x 5: Drop snatch, these help me with getting to the bottom postion
  * 4 x 5: Hang Power snatch

  * Progress weights each set starting with the 20kg barbell, and going up to 60, 80

90kg
  * 5 x 3: Felt relatively comfortable with 3 reps, will aim for 5 next week
