# Dynamically adding `params` to `hx-get` requests using AlpineJs

Since yesterday, I've been trying to understand how to add `params` dynamically to an `hx-get` request. It has been a bit of a challenge, I have solved the problem but I'm not sure if it's the best way to do this. I'm hoping someone reading this could direct me to a better way of doing this.

## Approach 1: Using `hx-params` (Couldn't get this working)

This one seemed the most obvious, and my understanding is that you can filter the parameters sent in the Ajax request. I'm guessing it's filtered from the `URLSearchParams`, this is where I might have been wrong.

This is what I tried:
```html
<section hx-params="period">
	...
	<article hx-get="/get-data" hx-trigger="load, params-updated"></article>
	...
</section>
```

Since, Alpine code was updating the URL search params, I assumed this would just work.

My expectation was that, when the `params-updated` event was fired, a request would be sent with the updated param, in this case `period`. But it always kept sending:

```
GET /get-data?period=undefined
```


### Approach 2: Using `hx-include` 

```html
<section hx-include="[name='period']">
	<input type="hidden" name="period" :value="params.period" />
	...
	<article hx-get="/get-data" hx-trigger="load, params-updated"></article>
	...
</section>
```

This does work, although I'm not a fan of using hidden inputs. The `:value` is just Alpine binding that dynamically updates the value.

The best part is that since `hx-include`  is inherited and can be placed on a parent element, all the rest of the elements just work.

## Open to Suggestions

I looked around the internet, the best I could find was one that resembled similarly to the one above. Although, it still super simple and not a big deal, I was wondering if someone out there knew of a better way to achieve the same.

Thank you for reading.
