# IoIgnition: Simple analytics, privacy friendly

## Why?

In all honesty, wanted something to do. Something that would be challenging, new, and 
help me practice the habit of building things.

Analytics, sounds like fun. I have no idea it works, and don't think it'll hurt to understand. 
Even though I have no idea how it works, I was like it might be too easy to 
just do analytics. So I want to be to able to analyse real time data as well, i.e. after v1 is released.


## How do you build something that you have no idea about?

Did some search, asked chat gipty to come up with a plan to break it down into doable steps. I like how 
[plausible](https://plausible.io/) does it, so I'm going to take a lot of inspiration from there.

I'll also be reverse engineering a lot of it, improving and changing things where necessary.
